We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 
- [Terraform 1.5.3](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### ACM with DNS
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source      = "clouddrove/acm/aws"
  version     = "1.3.0"
  name        = "certificate"
  environment = "test"
  label_order = ["name", "environment"]

  enable_aws_certificate    = true
  domain_name               = "clouddrove.com"
  subject_alternative_names = ["www.clouddrove.com"]
  validation_method         = "DNS"
  enable_dns_validation     = false
}
```

### ACM with Email
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source      = "clouddrove/acm/aws"
  version     = "1.3.0"
  name        = "certificate"
  environment = "test"
  label_order = ["name", "environment"]

  validate_certificate      = false
  domain_name               = "clouddrove.com"
  subject_alternative_names = ["www.clouddrove.com"]
  validation_method         = "EMAIL"
  enable_aws_certificate    = true
}
```

### ACM with Import Certificate
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source      = "clouddrove/acm/aws"
  version     = "1.3.0"
  name        = "certificate"
  environment = "test"
  label_order = ["name", "environment"]

  import_certificate = true
  private_key        = "./../../../clouddrove-private-key.pem"
  certificate_body   = "./../../../clouddrove-cert.pem"
  certificate_chain  = "./../../../clouddrove-chain.crt"
}
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| allow\_overwrite | Whether to allow overwrite of Route53 records | `bool` | `true` | no |
| certificate\_body | Path of certificate body. | `string` | `"~"` | no |
| certificate\_chain | Path of certificate chain. | `string` | `""` | no |
| domain\_name | A domain name for which the certificate should be issued. | `string` | `""` | no |
| enable | Whether or not to enable the entire module or not. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enable\_aws\_certificate | Set to false to prevent the creation of a acm certificate. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enable\_dns\_validation | Set to prevent validation of DNS. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| import\_certificate | Set to true or false to decide the creation and import of a acm certificate. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | <pre>[<br>  "name",<br>  "environment"<br>]</pre> | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| private\_key | Path of private key. | `string` | `""` | no |
| private\_zone | Used with name field to get a private Hosted Zone. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm"` | no |
| subject\_alternative\_names | Set of domains that should be SANs in the issued certificate. To remove all elements of a previously configured list, set this value equal to an empty list ([]) or use the terraform taint command to trigger recreation. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| ttl | Time to live. | `number` | `600` | no |
| validate\_certificate | Set to false to prevent the validation of a acm certificate. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| validation\_method | Which method to use for validation, DNS or EMAIL. | `string` | `""` | no |
| validation\_option | The domain name that you want ACM to use to send you validation emails. This domain name is the suffix of the email addresses that you want ACM to use. | `any` | `{}` | no |
| validation\_record\_fqdns | When validation is set to DNS and the DNS validation records are set externally, provide the fqdns for the validation | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| acm\_certificate\_domain\_validation\_options | A list of attributes to feed into other resources to complete certificate validation. Can have more than one element, e.g. if SANs are defined. Only set if DNS-validation was used. |
| acm\_certificate\_status | Status of the certificate. |
| arn | The ARN of the Certificate. |
| id | The ID of the Certificate. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |
| validation\_route53\_record\_fqdns | List of FQDNs built using the zone domain and name. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
